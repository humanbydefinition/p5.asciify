## Introduction

This website is a documentation project for the `p5.asciify` library, which is an add-on library for the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) JavaScript library.

This documentation is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and is hosted on a Virtual Private Server *(VPS)* provided by Hetzner. Our application runs on a Coolify instance, which manages the necessary services for this application.

As service providers, Hetzner may collect certain technically necessary data *(including IP addresses)* in accordance with their privacy policy.

This website uses Umami for anonymous analytics. Umami is a privacy-friendly, cookie-less analytics solution that anonymizes all collected data and does not track users across websites.

The following anonymous data may be collected:
