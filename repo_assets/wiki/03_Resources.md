# Fonts

By default, when no font is provided by the user using `loadAsciiFont()`, the amazing textmode font [`UrsaFont`](https://ursafrank.itch.io/ursafont) by [`UrsaFrank`](https://www.stormrooster.com/) is used as a default, which can be redistributed and modified under the [CC0 1.0 Universal License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

Besides that, the following textmode/pixel fonts have been tested to work well with `p5.asciify` and are free to download:
